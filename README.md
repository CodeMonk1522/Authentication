Authentication System with Node.js
This project demonstrates a complete authentication system built using Node.js, Express.js, React (with Vite), and MongoDB. It covers core authentication concepts, including user registration, secure password hashing, login, session management, and JWT-based token authentication, all while adhering to a structured and scalable architecture.

Features
User Registration: Includes input validation for secure and clean data handling.
Secure Password Storage: Utilizes password hashing with bcrypt to enhance security.
Login System: Supports session-based or token-based authentication with JWT.
Role-Based Access Control: (Optional) Assign roles to users and manage resource access accordingly.
Logout Functionality: Safely terminates sessions or invalidates tokens.
Responsive Frontend: Built with React, Vite, and Tailwind CSS for a modern UI.
Scalable Project Architecture: Structured to allow easy extension and maintenance.
Tech Stack

Frontend:
React: Component-based frontend library for building user interfaces.
